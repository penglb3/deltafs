# DeltaFS (that actually runs)
[Original repo](https://github.com/pdlfs/deltafs)

[My issue (rant) on the original](https://github.com/pdlfs/deltafs/issues/8)

This is my debugged and syscall-hooked version. Unlike the original, IT FKING WORKS.

## Building
Tested under Ubuntu 22.04 with gcc 11.4.0

### Install Dependencies
I tend to use openmpi, you can also use mpich if you like.
```bash
sudo apt install gcc g++ make autoconf automake libtool pkg-config
sudo apt install cmake checkinstall
sudo apt install libsnappy-dev libgflags-dev libgoogle-glog-dev
sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev libjson-c-dev
```

### Install libfabric
**DONT USE APT TO DO THIS** in Ubuntu 22.04, that one's version is too old. Compile from source.
```bash
wget https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/download/v1.21.0/libfabric-1.21.0.tar.bz2
tar -xjf libfabric-1.21.0.tar.bz2
cd libfabric-1.21.0
./configure && make -j
sudo checkinstall -y
# If you need to deploy deltafs over multiple machines
# then we need the .deb package generated by checkinstall
cd ..
```

### Install mercury RPC framework
```bash
# mercury wants this
sudo bash -c "echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope"
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mercury-hpc/mercury.git
# My version: https://github.com/mercury-hpc/mercury/tree/73df83f039971575cd04b6be58402bafe54da05a
cd mercury
cmake -B build -DNA_USE_OFI=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build
cd build
sudo checkinstall -pkgname mercury -y
cd ../..
```
If you see rpc related testings fail, it might be that your machine has more CPUs than the default handle max in testing code. 
In that case simply change the `HG_TEST_HANDLE_MAX` variable in `Testing/unit/hg/mercury_unit.c` to a bigger value, then all tests should pass.

### Get DeltaFS source code and compile
```bash
# Use my version, or how are you going to run mdtest?
git clone https://github.com/penglb3/deltafs.git
cd deltafs
cmake -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DDELTAFS_COMMON_INTREE=ON -DDELTAFS_MPI=ON -DPDLFS_MERCURY_RPC=ON -DPDLFS_GFLAGS=ON -DPDLFS_GLOG=ON -DPDLFS_SNAPPY=ON
cmake --build build
cd build
sudo checkinstall -pkgname deltafs -y --include libdeltafs.so.1
cd ..
```

## Running
### Local Testing
Server side:
```bash
DELTAFS_MetadataSrvAddrs=127.0.0.1:10101 ./build/src/server/deltafs-srvr -v=1 -logtostderr
```

Client side:
```bash
DELTAFS_MetadataSrvAddrs=127.0.0.1:10101 DELTAFS_NumOfMetadataSrvs=1 ./build/src/cmds/deltafs-shell -v=1 -logtostderr
```

To run on multiple machines instead of local, change all IPs above to real IPs.

### Run mdtest
I have added a hook to syscalls (`hook.c`) that will direct certain requests into DeltaFS logic, link the mdtest with it and you can test DeltaFS with mdtest.

I will assume that you have already downloaded and compiled ior/mdtest and omit its installation steps here.
If you haven't, you can get it from [ior official github site](https://github.com/hpc/ior).

Server side is the same as above. On client side you run:
```bash
mpirun -n 2 env DELTAFS_MetadataSrvAddrs=127.0.0.1:10101 DELTAFS_NumOfMetadataSrvs=1 LD_PRELOAD=./build/src/libdeltafs/libdeltafs-hook.so mdtest -d /dfs/mdtest -n 10
```

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
- **Make sure to include the "/dfs" prefix in path.** It is the signal that the hook should hand this request to DeltaFS instead of your local FS.
- **Restart the server after each run and DO NOT USE `-i` parameter**. DeltaFS does NOT SUPPORT `rmdir` and `rename` (and their `unlink` checks for file type, very droll indeed) so the directory created can never be deleted. The hook pretends that these operations work but in fact they don't and never will, I do this just to make running mdtest easier. This also means **mdtest results for Dir Rename and Dir Remove ARE UNRELIABLE**.
- 
- If you don't see `libdeltafs-hook.so`, check if `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` is turned on for DeltaFS.

Again, if you want to run it across multiple machines, replace the metadata server address with real IPs. 

## Deploying and testing on multiple machines
### Setting up clients
Make sure you did all 3 `checkinstall` steps above because we are gonna need to distribute them now.
To automate deployment, we use ansible. You can get it by:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ansible/ansible
sudo apt install -y ansible
```
Then you copy all debs into build directory and run the ansible to set up all machines:
```bash
cp ../libfabric-1.21.0/*.deb build/
cp ../mercury/*.deb build/
# You can ls build/*.deb to check that you do have 3 packages.
ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml
```
An example of inventory is given in the repo, you can customize it based on your environments.

### Testing (using multiple clients across multiple machines)
Starting multiple deltafs server is similar as above, just use `mpirun`
```bash
mpirun -n 2 env "DELTAFS_MetadataSrvAddrs=10.10.1.7:10101&10.10.1.7:10102" deltafs-srvr -v=1 -logtostderr
```

The clients can also be started via `mpirun` on the server machine. Note that I have copied `mdtest` to user's home dir in advance.
```bash
mpirun -n 4 --host node7:2,node8:2 env LD_PRELOAD=/usr/local/lib/libdeltafs-hook.so "DELTAFS_MetadataSrvAddrs=10.10.1.7:10101&10.10.1.7:10102" DELTAFS_NumOfMetadataSrvs=2 ~/mdtest -d /dfs/mdtest -n 100000
```
**!! AGAIN! RESTART THE SERVER AFTER EACH RUN !!**
